abstract="We present a digital signature scheme where users sign by using a password instead of a long secret key. Our approach uses a signing server to prevent dictionary attacks. We present two efficient and secure schemes, both based on blind signatures. Our schemes are resistant against dictionary attacks from anyone except the signing server.",
