\section{Skeleton of Our Proposal}

Tokens, signature and the certificates to be generated accordingly. Unique signing key and certificate. Is there any other approaches? Having several  secret keys to generate from different $\idm$. Currently, we have some blank tokens and embed a hash of a PDF document. Asking the IdM

If we trust the identification system of Google/Meta is secure - no other user can impersonate the user to login, then signature service for the users could happen by them.
