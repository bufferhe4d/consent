\section{Introduction}

Giving a consent for an action is a common social/legal interaction. One can give a power of attorney to sign a document on behalf of them or one can ask to store their keys in a storage service for a period of time. Any action that is being done on behalf of an entity requires the explicit permission from that entity. This can be modeled as a consent. In this work, we introduce the notion of digital consents. Essentially, a client can cast an order to their \emph{agent} so that the agent can log the consent of the client. The consent should be non-repudiable. We aim to cryptographically model the idea of giving consent.

\serge{Focus on several modalities for consent. Normal use with a client having a secure hardware (smartphone), but requiring backup solutions when the device is lost/broken or even stolen (think of revokation). Alternate use with a password + IdM. Alternate use with biometry + IdM. Can we distribute the agent to get rid of the IdM? Can we use several IdM to get rid of password/biometry?}
