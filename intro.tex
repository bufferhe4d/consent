\section{Introduction}

Giving a consent for an action is a common social/legal interaction. One can give a power of attorney to sign a document on behalf of them or one can ask to store their keys in a storage service for a period of time. Any action that is being done on behalf of an entity with the permission from that entity can be modeled as a consent. In this work, we introduce the notion of digital consents. We aim to cryptographically model the idea of giving consent.
